To run the database server locally you need to:

- Install a MySQL server and client (I use MySQL Community Server and MySQL Workbench)
- Make sure the MySQL server is running (In windows I had to go into Services to start it). The server assumes that MySQL is running on localhost:3306 and the root user has no password. These should be the default settings.
- Run the sql scripts found in /server/sql folder using the MySQL client to create and populate the database(run populate_student_milestone.sql last because it uses foreign keys)
- Run `npm install` in the server directory to install dependencies
- Run `node server.js` to start the server
- If the server and database are running correctly, going to localhost:3001/student in a browser should return an array of jsons object filled with mock student data

To run the client run "npm start" in the client directory  
Both the client and the server need to be running for the app to fetch/update data from the database
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
